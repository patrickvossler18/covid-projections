üëÄ Overview

Covid Projections Tracker is a tool that allows experts to easily track projection accuracy as well as changes in projections over time. Projectons may change as new data is incorporated or when model parameters or frameworks are updated. Covid Projections is under active development, current features are shown here.

##### Interactive Dashboard:
- Historical model projections for a given country or region (currently supports IHME and LANL data)
- Toggle between linear and semi-log plots
- Select models with forecast dates within a given date range

##### Data Scraper:
Displaying a model on our website is not an endorsement of model accuracy. We currently display historical trends for IHME and LANL models primarily because they were the first groups to make their data easily accessible.

- [IHME](http://www.healthdata.org/covid/data-downloads) - Non-linear mixed effects curve-fitting.
- [LANL](https://covid-19.bsvgateway.org/#link%20to%20forecasting%20site) - Statistical dynamical growth model accounting for population susceptibility.
